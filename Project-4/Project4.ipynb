    "Your first goal is to analyze the performance of several genetic algorithms in the context of parameter-estimation. Your second goal is to analyze the results, i.e. what do we learn about the model? In this project, we are revisiting Goldbeter's 5-state fly clock model, whose parameters were originally chosen \"by hand.\" You will use a cost function which ensures the oscillations in constant darkness have a period of 23.6 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many variants of genetic algorithms. We will be using the following algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",

    "            <li><b>Select</b> the breeding pool $P$ of $\\mu$ individuals from the previous generation.\n",
    "        <li>For i in range($eliteCount$,$\\lambda$)\n",
    "            <ul>\n",
    "            <li>Randomly choose two parents from $P$.\n",
    "            <li>Use <b>cross-over</b> to generate a child $G^g_i$.\n",

    "</ul>   \n",
    "\n",
    "The key operators and parameters can be varied:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Selection can favor fit (low-cost) parents more or less, and always has an aspect of randomness. If we favor low-cost parents more, then the algorithm converges quickly, but it doesn't explore parameter space very well, and could miss a more fit individual. If we favor them less, the algorithm might not find children of increasingly good fitness. Explanations of several selection operators may be found in: Blickle, T. and Thiele, L. 1995. A comparison of selection schemes used in genetic algorithms. Tech. Rep. TIK-Report 11, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland, May.\n",
    "    <li>Crossover is typically \"uniform\" (each element of the child is randomly taken from one of its two parents) or \"single\" (a cross-over point is selected and all elements up to the cross-over point are taken from one parent and the remaining elements are taken from the second parent).\n",
    "    <li>Mutation is typically implemented by choosing a value from a Gaussian distribution centered on each element. One straightforward way to vary the mutation is to vary the width of the distribution. We control the size of the mutation by scaling the width of the Gaussian distribution (it should be $mutationScale\\cdot parameterValue$).\n",
    "    <li>The number of parents $\\mu$ and children $\\lambda$ affects how widely we can sample space. Large numbers of children allow for a broader sampling. The number of parents (the size of the breeding pool) should be a fraction of the number of children (typically, it is a number like 1/5). It works with the selection operator to control how broadly the space is searched and how quickly the algorithm progresses towards a solution. The number of children that you need to use depends upon the problem. It can range from in the tens (e.g. our simple island cost function from class) to thousands.\n",
    "    <li>The number of elite individuals should be small (e.g. 1 to 3). Including elites guarantees that the best-fit individual in generation $g$ will be at least as fit as the best-fit individual in generation $g-1$.\n",
    "    <li>The number of generations should be as big as it needs to be for the best (or average) cost to stop improving. For some problems, thousands of generations are used. Here, we are able to use many fewer (e.g. I used 5 for the simple island cost function in class)\n",
    "</ul>  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> Run each algorithm on the fly model at least 5 times for each ``flavor'' for at least 5 generations,  i.e. analyze performance for \n",
    "\t<ol>\n",

    "\t<li> a GA with linear ranking selection, an elite count of 1, 10 parents, 50 children, and a mutation fraction of 0.05\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "<li> Report your results in a concise, but informative manner. You will want to identify trends. To do this, quantify the performance of the algorithm. For example, determine the mean population cost for each generation and plot how that changes across generations.\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implication for Model\n",
    "Using some of your output from above, analyze the effects of different parameters on the model's performance. Below are suggestions to guide your analysis. Follow at least one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> How different are the optimization results? i.e. how different are the sets of model parameters (e.g. rate constants and activation thresholds) that are found by different runs of the GA?  \n",
    "<li> You may see different relationships between amplitudes of clock components. Do you see any patterns in this behavior? (e.g. is the peak mRNA concentration always bigger (or always smaller) than the peak P1 concentration?) If so, maybe you can conclude that the relative amplitude is not a property of the model's parameters, but that it is a property of its structure. Make a detailed case for your conclusion.\n",
    "<li> Choose several optimization results and determine whether or not the non-intuitive behavior mentioned in Goldbeter's paper occurs. In his paper, he showed that increasing the rate of Per protein degradation ($v_d$) increases the total PER in the system. Is this true for multiple optimization results (i.e. model parameter sets)?\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Implement proportional selection and include analysis of the GA with proportional selection it in your write-up.\n",
    "<li> Include additional analysis with different values of the algorithm's parameters. What happens if the number of children per generation is different? What about increasing or decreasing the mutation fraction?\n",
    "<li> Include simulated annealing in your set of optimization algorithms.\n",
    "<li> Implement a simulated annealing optimization algorithm.\n",
    "<li> Make a hybrid algorithm that uses both a GA (or simulated annealing) and a deterministic method (e.g. a hill-descending method). The idea is that the stochastic algorithms helps you find the right region of parameter space, and that in that region, the cost function will be smooth (and maybe even monotonic). Once we are in a region that is smooth and monotonic, we can use a deterministic optimization method to refine our parameter set to find the local optimum.\n",
    "<li> Include amplitude in the cost function for Goldbeter's model: add a penalty for each state variable whose peak-to-trough amplitude is less than 0.1.\n",
    "<li> Also find parameters for the Gonze/Goodwin oscillator.\n",
