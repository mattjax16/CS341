    "<li> Use your genetic algorithm to generate 10 excellent parameter sets (i.e. run the algorithm 10 times and use the lowest cost child from each run). You may use parameter sets you found in Project 4 or you may generate new parameter sets.\n",
    "<li> For each of the parameter sets, analyze the sensitivity of the amplitude and of the period (separately) to each parameter. If at all possible, please plot the results for all parameter sets on the same graph (a box-and-whisker plot might be helpful here).\n",
    "<li> What are the similarities and differences in sensitivity across parameter sets? For example, are there any parameter which make the period longer in some parameter sets, but shorter in others? Are there any parameters that have radically different sensitivities across the parameter sets?\n",
